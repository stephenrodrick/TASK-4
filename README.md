Project Overview

This project demonstrates how data analysis and basic statistical methods can be used to validate business decisions and drive measurable impact. The objective was to evaluate whether a proposed business change (new website layout) led to a statistically significant improvement in conversion rate, and to present the findings in a clear, stakeholder-ready format.

The project follows a business storytelling approach, transforming raw analysis into actionable insights supported by statistical evidence.

🎯 Business Objective

To determine whether the new website layout resulted in a significant increase in conversion rate, and to provide a data-backed recommendation to stakeholders for decision-making.

🧠 Business Problem

Website conversion rate was below industry benchmarks

User drop-offs were observed during the checkout process

Leadership required quantitative validation before rolling out design changes at scale

🧪 Hypothesis Formulation

Null Hypothesis (H₀):
The new website layout has no impact on conversion rate.

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):
The new website layout leads to a statistically significant increase in conversion rate.

Confidence Level: 95%

Significance Level (α): 0.05

📂 Dataset Overview

Sample Size: 20,000 user sessions

Groups:

Control Group: Old Website Layout

Test Group: New Website Layout

Key Metric: Conversion Rate

Time Period: 30 days

📊 Methodology

Conducted an A/B Test comparing old vs new website layout

Used Chi-Square Test for Proportions, appropriate for conversion rate comparison

Measured statistical significance using p-value analysis

📈 Key Findings

Conversion rate increased by 12.5% with the new layout

p-value = 0.02, which is less than 0.05

Result is statistically significant, indicating the improvement is unlikely due to random chance

📌 Statistical Conclusion

The null hypothesis was rejected.
There is strong statistical evidence that the new website layout improves conversion rate.

💼 Business Impact

Increased conversions directly translate to higher revenue

Improved user experience enhances customer engagement

Better conversion efficiency reduces customer acquisition costs

Results are scalable and reliable for long-term implementation

🚀 Recommendations (Call to Action)

Roll out the new website layout to all users

Continuously monitor conversion rate and related KPIs

Conduct further A/B tests to optimize other user journey elements
